# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for GaneshEEE/testing2

This project, a simple HTML login page, requires a different approach for testing compared to projects with more complex structures.  Since there's no backend or server-side logic, testing focuses on the client-side functionality and validation. Playwright will be used for browser testing.

**1. Adding the Workflow File**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository. This file will contain the GitHub Actions configuration.

```yaml
name: Test Login Page

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Playwright
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16 # Or a suitable Node version for Playwright

      - name: Install Playwright Dependencies
        run: npm install playwright

      - name: Run Playwright Tests
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'  # Or a suitable Python version

      - name: Run Playwright Tests
        run: |
          npx playwright test
```

**2. Environment Variables (None required for this project)**


**3. Dependencies (Install locally)**

*   **Playwright:**  You need to install Playwright locally to run the tests locally.  Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install playwright
```
This command will install the playwright package locally.  The workflow file above installs it globally within the GitHub Actions environment.  **Crucially, this assumes you're using Node.js, which you will need to manage using `node`, `npm` or `yarn` (if you want to use npm or yarn).**


**4. Configuring Playwright**

You need to create a `.playwright` directory in the root of your repository. Within this directory, create a `test.spec.js` file with the following structure:

```javascript
// test.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Login Page', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:8080/login.html');
  // Add your tests here for the login page (filling email/password, checking for success/failure messages).
  // Example:
  // const emailField = await page.locator('input[name="email"]');
  // await emailField.fill('john.doe@example.com');
  // ...
});

```

**5. Viewing Test Results**

GitHub Actions will output the test results to the GitHub Actions workflow run page. Look for the "test" job in the run history.  If tests fail, detailed error messages will be provided.


**6. Troubleshooting**

*   **Playwright installation errors:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.  Verify the npm install command completes without errors.
*   **Tests failing:** Double-check the selectors (e.g., `input[name="email"]`) in your tests are correct.  Ensure the test script is correctly targeting elements.
*   **HTML issues:**  If tests fail because of HTML parsing, verify that `login.html` validates correctly.  Use a validator (e.g., https://validator.w3.org/).


**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps**

*   **Local Server:** Open a terminal in your project directory and start a simple server using Node and the `http` module (or a static file server):
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```
   This command starts a simple server. Access the login page by visiting `http://localhost:8080/login.html` in your browser.

*   **HTML Validation:** Use an HTML validation tool to check for errors and potential problems with your `login.html` file.

*   **Cross-Browser Testing:** The approach described here assumes your page renders correctly in different browsers. To verify this, try loading your `login.html` page in different browsers.


**Important Considerations (Crucial!)**

*   **Selectors:** The `test.spec.js` file relies on correctly identifying HTML elements (e.g., inputs) using selectors.  Your selectors need to accurately match the elements in your `login.html` file.


These instructions, along with the `test.spec.js` template, will guide you in setting up Playwright tests for your HTML login page within your GitHub Actions pipeline. Remember to replace placeholder comments and selectors with your specific login form elements. Remember to install Node.js, npm, and Playwright before running these commands. Remember that, without backend code or external resources, your tests will verify only the *presentation* and *interaction* of the HTML page.  A missing backend would mean that nothing is validated beyond that presentation.
